# Sample Code and Documentation from previous experience

I've included a screen recording of the screens involved though the code can not be run. This code is used to display opportunities, similar to a job board.

In this code I wish to highlight my use of the following :

* async/await and @MainActor
* Core Data - In particular the fetch controller for fetching and displaying Opportunities
* Caching images

Opportunities feature screen recording:
